We were aiming to see the highest and lowest win percentages of title winning teams per mnth across the last 10 years. Our findings are that teams usually peak around August, April and December.
The lowest win percentage was on September at 60%.
We can speculate that they typically start strongly in August (80.65%) to set the tone, gather alot of momentum in December(78.57%) as the games come in thick and fast and finish very strongly in the run-in in April(78.57%).
May may be low in this context due to some title winning teams having already wrapped up the league by then.
